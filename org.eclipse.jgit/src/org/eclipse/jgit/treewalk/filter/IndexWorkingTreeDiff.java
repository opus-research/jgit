/**
 * A performance optimized variant of {@link TreeFilter#ANY_DIFF} which should
 * be used when among the walked trees there is a {@link DirCacheIterator} and a
 * {@link WorkingTreeIterator}. Please see the documentation of
 * {@link TreeFilter#ANY_DIFF} for a basic description of the semantics.
 * <p>
 * This filter tries to avoid computing content id's of the files in the
 * working-tree. In contrast to {@link TreeFilter#ANY_DIFF} this filter takes
 * care to first compare the entry from the {@link DirCacheIterator} with the
 * entries from all other iterators besides the {@link WorkingTreeIterator}.
 * Since all those entries have fast access to content id's that is very fast.
 * If a difference is detected in this step this filter decides to include that
 * path before even looking at the working-tree entry.
 * <p>
 * If no difference is found then we have to compare DirCache and working-tree
 * as the last step. By making use of
 * {@link WorkingTreeIterator#isModified(org.eclipse.jgit.dircache.DirCacheEntry, boolean, boolean)}
 * we can avoid the computation of the content id if the file is not dirty.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this filter should not be used for multiple {@link TreeWalk}s.
 * Always construct a new instance of this filter for each TreeWalk.
